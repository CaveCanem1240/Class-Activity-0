Hi. 

 

This is Faisal Rehman (RF) with Computing ID (qnp9me) - PhD Student from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering UVA.

I am interested in the field of Electronics System Design, Wearable Embedded Systems, Material Engineering, and Micro/ Nano Electronics fabrications.



I hope this course will boost my skills for real-time implantation of an embedded system. 

 

Thank you.
