Undergraduate course at BUET 
- Microcontroller and embedded systems). I am familiar with C/C++, ATMEGA32 microcontroller and built an automated hand washing system using this mcu. Link to project details: https://youtu.be/46omGCgZCx0
- Operating systems. Experimented with the xv6 operating system
- Computer architecture - built a 4 bit pc

I am interested in systems research particularly how to use tiny devices to run large models. I hope to learn more about embedded devices and their working methodology from this course.
