Eric Choi, esc4st
Courses: EAR I & II (previous TA for EAR I), ECE Computer Architecture, ECE/CPE Capstone, currently taking OS; Microcontrollers: MSP432, MSP430, Arduinos (UNO, Mega, Leonardo), Raspberry Pi Pico; Programming Lanuages: For embedded systems I have only really used C/C++, but I have played around with the Arduino programming language and the Raspberry Pi Python SDK
I am interested in a lot of technical topics with embedded systems being a more recently developed interest starting from the EAR courses. I will be working as an embedded software engineer after completing my undergraduate degree this semester (and I will probably pursue a Masters in Computer Engineering while working). As such, I hope to learn information, techniques, and practices that I can implement while working in the future.
