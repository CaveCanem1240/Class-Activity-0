Kidus Fasil, kf5fr

Hi my name is Kidus and I am a third year computer engineering major. I have taken intro to embedded (ECE 3430) and Embedded Computing and Robotics 1(ECE 3501)
which both use the MSP432 and programming in C. I also plan to take Computer Architecture and Design (ECE 4435) and Operating Systems (CS 4414) this semester. 
I have also done some mini projects using the Arduino IDE including a portable fan.

I am interested in topics such as digital signal processing and embedded systems. I hope with this class I will enhance my knowledge 
about embedded software development and operating systems with hands on projects and assignments and introduce me to other topics that 
are not traditionally taught in other electives related to operating systems.
